# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Stock analysis automation

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that takes in a company stock symbole and gathers information and computes relevent ratios compared with an industry average.

TODO
To give a recomendation on whether or not to buy stock in the compnay.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I am still working on the details. I want to use XBRL to pull information from the SEC filings to direclty import information into python for analysis.

I then want the program to compute financial ratios in python and compare them to industry averages, provided by the program. 
Once the comparision is made I want the program to make a recomendation on what an investor should do, buy, hold, or sell.

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable
I will not combine projects

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
I am not colaberating
TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

IT will read a prepared file, compute relevent financial ratios, compare them to my inputed industy averages, and make a recomendation to buy, hold or sell.
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Here it will take a stock symbol and actually pull a live file from the SEC filing using XBRL (A SEC regulated filing language used by accountants) directly into python.
TODO
COmputing relevent ratios and comparing to my prepared industry averages, or computing ones if possible, and making a recomendation.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Here it will take a stock symbole and industy, any symbol, actually pull a live file from the SEC filing using XBRL (A SEC regulated filing language used by accountants) directly into python.
TODO
COmputing relevent ratios and comparing to computed industry averages from the program searching for industry competitors and comuting thier ratios, and making a recomendation.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I need to learn how to use XBRL with python and how to lay out this complex program. I think I have some of the skills needed. But I will need todo more research to complete this project. 
I am only in the early planning stages and plan to work on this over the weekend.
