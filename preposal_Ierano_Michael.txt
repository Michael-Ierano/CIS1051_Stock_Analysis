# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to input a stock symbol and have my program pull an excel file and calculate relevant financial ratios.
Then take those ratios and compare them to industry averages, and finally make a recommendation of whether or not to buy the stock and why.

TODO
This would work well with my major, accounting, and help build a base program that I can add to in the future to allow me to slightly automate my stock buying strategy.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will work on my own.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I would like my program to download the excel files from the SEC website, is there a way to do this in python?
Would it be too difficult to download a file and perform calculations when the data is labeled slightly differently from company to company?
